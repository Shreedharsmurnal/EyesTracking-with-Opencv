 # Eyes Tracking Opencv python üëÅÔ∏è üëÅÔ∏è
 
 Estimate the position of eyes in the frame using computer Vision Techniques.
 
 
 # Eyes Tracking with Mediapipe
 
 
 1)Mediapipe way more faster, has more landmarks, it can reach up to 30 fps as well. while dilb reach about 10fps
 
 2)Mediapipe is easy to install, just with pip command
 
 3)mediapipe does not require extra things, visual studio, cmake, etc on windows machine,
